                <h3>Hi, I'm Taimur!</h3>
                <p>
                    I am a Full-Stack Developer and Engineer from Toronto, Canada ðŸ‘‹ 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    
                    I am also a business school graduate and finance professional with years of experience in leading corporate process improvements, tool building, and system integrations. I enjoy using my fundamental business knowledge and consumer oriented experiences, 
                    along with my knowledge of multiple technical languages, to create exceptional applications and unique solutions to daily problems. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    I believe that my background in business has provided me with the perfect balance between cross-functional, collaborative work and a focused 'heads-down' approach to problem-solving.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Thank you for visiting my page!
