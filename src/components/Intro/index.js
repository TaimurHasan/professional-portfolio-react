                Thank you for visiting my page! 
                I am a business school graduate and finance professional with a passion for technology and development. I enjoy using my fundamental business knowledge and consumer oriented experiences, 
                along with my knowledge of multiple technical languages, to create exceptional applications and unique solutions. I believe that my background in business has provided me with the perfect balance between cross-functional, collaborative work and a focused 'heads-down' approach to problem-solving.
